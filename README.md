# RiskSmart Tech Test

## British Geological Survey Sensors Plotter

### Introduction

The British Geological Survey (BGS) is a world-leading geological survey and global geoscience organisation, focused on public-good science for government and research to understand earth and environmental processes.

They are the UKâ€™s premier provider of objective and authoritative geoscientific data, information and knowledge to help society to use its natural resources responsibly, manage environmental change and be resilient to environmental hazards.

### The task

BGS collects an processes a large amount of data from various sensors across the UK. Build a simple web application that presents the user with a list of Features of Interests. Each (well, most) Feature will have a list of observations associated with it. An observation is a piece of numerical data collected from one of the sensors located at the site. When a user selects a feature, display a dropdown list with all the sensors that have an observation for that features. When the user selects a sensor display the following observation details:

- Min
- Max
- Mean
- A plot of the results over time

### Technical details

The BGS API docs can be accessed at [https://sensors-docs.bgs.ac.uk/](https://sensors-docs.bgs.ac.uk/). This is a free and open API, you don't need to authenticate but be mindful that if you make too many requests you could get rate-limited.

We use React and TypeScript at RiskSmart but that doesn't mean you have to. Use a language and framework that demonstrate your skills the best. We also don't expect you to build a fancy UI, keep it simple ([CloudScape Design System](https://cloudscape.design/) is great choice, it also does charts).

### Considerations

- Volume, there's a lot of data being returned by the API
- Error handling, not every feature or sensor will have meaningful data
