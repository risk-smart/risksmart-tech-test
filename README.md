## British Geological Survey Sensors Plotter

### Introduction

The British Geological Survey (BGS) is a world-leading geological survey and global geoscience organisation, focused on public-good science for government and research to understand earth and environmental processes.

They are the UKâ€™s premier provider of objective and authoritative geoscientific data, information and knowledge to help society to use its natural resources responsibly, manage environmental change and be resilient to environmental hazards.

### The task

BGS collects an processes a large amount of data from various sensors across the UK. Build a simple web application that presents the user with a list of Features of Interests. Once a feature has been selected display a secondary list with a list of datastreams associated with the selected feature. When the user selects one of the available datasets, calculate and display the following details:

- Number of data points
- Min
- Max
- Mean

If you can, plot the datapoints on a chart. Make sure to use a sensible time window, there's a lot of data.

### Technical details

The BGS API docs can be accessed at [https://sensors-docs.bgs.ac.uk/](https://sensors-docs.bgs.ac.uk/). This is a free and open API, you don't need to authenticate but be mindful that if you make too many requests you could get rate-limited.

We use React and TypeScript at RiskSmart but that doesn't mean you have to. Use a language and framework that demonstrate your skills the best. We also don't expect you to build a fancy UI, keep it simple (we use [CloudScape Design System](https://cloudscape.design/), it also does charts).

For this test, we will be excluding all cloud and CI/CD aspects. We want you to show us what you're capable of, and we will not be marking the test against a set criteria. We want you to think, pivot, and be creative, just as we do every day.

### Considerations

- Volume, there's a lot of data being returned by the API
- Error handling, not every feature will have meaningful data
